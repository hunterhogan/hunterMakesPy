"""Access comprehensive test suites for the hunterMakesPy package.

(AI generated docstring)

You can use this package to run test suites that validate all major functions and features
in hunterMakesPy. The tests cover defensive programming utilities, parameter validation,
file system operations, and data structure manipulation. Each test module corresponds to a
public module in the parent package and can be executed independently using pytest [1].

The test suites use the conftest.py infrastructure for shared fixtures and test utilities.
Tests are organized by module with comprehensive coverage of edge cases, error conditions,
and typical usage patterns. You can import individual test functions or run entire test
modules to validate behavior in your environment.
